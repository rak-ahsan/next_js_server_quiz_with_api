About the App
This Quiz App is crafted with Next.js, a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. It fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API, providing an engaging and interactive quiz experience.

Open Trivia Database API
The app fetches trivia questions dynamically from the Open Trivia Database API. With a simple API request, you can access a wide range of trivia questions on various topics.

Exposing the API
While running the Next.js development server, the app will automatically fetch and display trivia questions from the API. However, please note that the API data won't be exposed directly to the network. For production deployment, you can set up a server-side solution to fetch and cache the data, ensuring optimal performance and security.
